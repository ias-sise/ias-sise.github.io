title: Attendance and participation (5%)
---

Under normal circumstances, the policy is: Attendance and participation in class are mandatory. Attendance will be recorded weekly. Points will be deducted for missing three or more classes without prior notice. Attendance is *mandatory in weeks 5, 12, and 13* where project proposal and presentations will take place. 

**This year, however, attendance is NOT REQUIRED**, but you are still graded on participation in the classes you do attend.
