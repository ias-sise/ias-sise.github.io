Internet, Algorithms, and Society seeks to provide students with a new, critical, and constructive perspective on the algorithms and data-driven decisions that reign over our online social lives. It goes back to the fundamental elements of the scientific method (observation, surveying, experimentation) and reenvisions how they can be combined and adapted for social research in the digital age. The course will introduce computational students to old and new questions and theories from the social sciences, and familiarize social science students with computational approaches from computer and engineering science.
