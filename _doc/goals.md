### The class has four main goals:

- Expose students to research methods and tools for making meaningful inferences from Big Data in general and social networks in particular. 
- Introduce students to recent literature and exemplary work that advances both social and data science. 
- Develop critical yet constructive thinking about the role of algorithms and systems' design in online social systems.
- Lower the barriers for multidisciplinary research across the social sciences and computing sciences.
